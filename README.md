# AcaFund

AcaFund is a financial management platform built for African student communities. It lets groups collect dues, track every naira through a community treasury, govern expense requests with an approval workflow, and publish transparency reports that any member can read.

## Architecture

![AcaFund Architecture](docs/acafund-architecture.svg)

The diagram above shows the full money flow: students pay through Monnify checkout or direct bank transfer, every payment is verified server-side before the ledger is credited, and all payouts are manual with a payout reference recorded before the ledger is debited.

## Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| API | Python 3.11, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0 |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 (SQLite in-memory for tests) |
| Payments | Monnify (NGN collections and reserved accounts) |
| AI assistant | NVIDIA Nemotron via the NVIDIA API |
| Container | Docker / docker-compose |
| Deploy | Render (Blueprint via render.yaml) |
| Frontend | React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS |

## Local development

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values described below

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env with your SECRET_KEY and any optional Monnify / NVIDIA keys

docker compose up          # starts postgres + api at http://localhost:8080
```

API docs are available at `http://localhost:8080/docs` once the container is up.

### Running tests

Tests run against an SQLite in-memory database so you do not need Postgres running locally.

```bash
docker compose exec api python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

To skip the live Monnify sandbox test:

```bash
docker compose exec api python -m pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/test_monnify_live.py -v
```

To run the live Monnify smoke test (requires real sandbox credentials in `.env`):

```bash
docker compose exec api sh -c "RUN_LIVE_MONNIFY_TESTS=1 python -m pytest tests/test_monnify_live.py -v -s"
```
